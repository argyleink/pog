# Tesla.js Command Line Interface

Git repo for the [Tesla.js](https://github.com/teslajs/tesla.js) command line interface.

## Installation

Install Tesla globally (recommended):

	npm install -g tesla-cli

Install Tesla locally:

	npm install tesla-cli

## Usage

Generate a new Tesla app called "lasers":

	tesla lasers
